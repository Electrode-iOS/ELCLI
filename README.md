# ELCLI

A framework for parsing command lines in Swift.

## Requirements

ELCLI requires Swift 2.1, Xcode 7.2 and depends on [`ELFoundation.framework`](https://github.com/Electrode-iOS/ELFoundation).

[Electrode-iOS](https://github.com/Electrode-iOS/) frameworks are designed to live side-by-side in the file system, like so:

* \MyProject
* \MyProject\ELFoundation

## Installation

Install by adding `ELCLI.xcodeproj` to your project and configuring your target to link `ELCLI.framework`.

## Usage
